# Electronic-Based-CVT-System
This project was done using Arduino (C++) to develop the electronic-based CVT system. Here basically used the fuzzy controller to handle the CVT pulleys properly. As a prototype project and initial stage of electronic-based CVT, here used Arduino Mega Board because its flash memory is enough.
